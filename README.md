Movie app created from scratch with ReactJS, a spinoff of a turtorial for Meals app by John Smilga.

Main focus was implementing and rendering API data, creating local storage and making the app responsive.
Features include search bar, favorites section if there is any favorite movie, modal to show movie plot, title and poster.
I used IMDB api for rendering the movies. 

What I learned with this project was creating local storage so liked movies are visible if the page is refreshed and sharpening CSS skills as CSS is also custom and no libraries or frameworks were used.
